<p>This project was made to understand how the architecture of a staking protocol works, the code of the main contract of our project is in `src/contracts/TokenFarm.sol`, how the tokens of the project are managed.</p>

<p>You can also see how the `ELLA` reward token and the `TCH` staking token were designed.</p>

<p>All the UI design that was done with React, you can find it in `src/components`.</p>

<p>It was challenging and fun to do this project, if you want to understand how the most famous staking protocols work in web3, this project will help you in a basic but functional aspect.</p>
